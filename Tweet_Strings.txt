Man, I'm so thirsty after that walk that I cou--SQUIRREL!
Every time I go to take a drink, there's always some other dog barking back at me!
*Lick, lick, lick* Man, this water is so go-AILMAN!
My human @adamprawitz gets so angry with me when I drool everywhere, but I'm #notashamed
There's casual dining, and then there's fine dining--the toilet water!
The mailman just dropped off what I think is a peace offering again while I was drinking? Yeah, say goodbye to your hand. #ouch
I just love this water, it's so fresh and cold and OH MY GOODNESS MY OWNER IS HOME!!!
The water bowl is just another toy! I love putting my paws in it! #ahh
My water bowl is just a miniature pool!
I really enjoy drinking toilet water!
I hate it when my water bowl sits there empty!
I'm gonna drink this H20 before my owner H2Gos off on me for drooling!
All the other dogs with their thirsty mouths gonna run when I drink, run when I drink!
Drink drink TAIL drink drink BALL drink drink CAT drink drink...
When your owner says "who's a good boy" even though you splash in the water bowl...
Whenever my owner leaves, I get SO nervous that he doesn't come back...I HAVE TO GO DRINK!
I decided to take a drink and th--BALL? BALL! BALL! BALL! BAL--false alarm, it was a squir--SQUIRREL!
I just filled up my own water bowl! It...tastes a little weird. Not as good as toilet water.
Drooling makes my owner @adamprawitz SO angry!
This Florida sun makes me SO thirsty!
